A simple ExpressionEngine2 plugin to grab the current page URL. Yes every man and his dog has written one of these. I like dogs.

An extremely simple plugin. You have the option of grabbing the complete url of the current page like so:
{exp:pitch_url full="yes"}
	
Or just grab the segments after the site_url:
{exp:pitch_url full="no"}
	
That's it, extremely simple.
